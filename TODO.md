## üîÅ Changes (New Features, Design Goals)

### ‚ú® Prompt Execution Modes

  - [ ] `PromptHandlers`
  - [ ] `FileTreeHandlers`
  - [ ] `SettingsHandlers`
- [ ] Add factory and registry support for LLM providers/summarizers

## üß™ Testing Roadmap

- [ ] Add Pytest-based unit tests
- [ ] Test prompt management logic
- [ ] Test `Worker` signal flow
- [ ] Test file manager CRUD ops
- [ ] Test configuration load/save accuracy
- [ ] Add QTest-based UI integration tests (edit/save/stream)

Notes:
The tree view does not show hidden (.file) files. We should surface any extensions/dirs/nice-to-be-able-tochange things that are being excluded in an 'advanced' section of the settings. Give me a plan for this.
